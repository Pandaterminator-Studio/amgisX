# AmgisX Electron

A simple Electron-based wrapper for the AmgisX top-down RPG engine. It loads the sample world data from `GameData/Worlds` and renders the first map using an HTML5 canvas.

The engine now includes a basic game loop that updates and redraws the scene each frame, providing a foundation for future gameplay features.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This will launch the Electron window and draw the sample map.

Contributions are welcome!
