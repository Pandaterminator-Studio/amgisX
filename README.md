# AmgisX Electron

A simple Electron-based wrapper for the AmgisX top-down RPG engine. It loads the sample world data from `GameData/Worlds` and renders the first map using an HTML5 canvas.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This will launch the Electron window and draw the sample map.

## Controls

- Arrow keys / WASD to move the operative
- Hold Shift while moving to sprint
- Sprinting drains stamina—watch the Operative Vitality HUD on the expedition screen to recover
- Hold R while standing still to rest and rapidly recover stamina
- E to interact with NPCs or objects
- I to open the inventory overlay
- Q to open the quest log
- +/- or 0 to adjust zoom levels

Contributions are welcome!
